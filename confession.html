    <h1 class="confession-title">I’m writing this slowly.</h1>

    <p>
      This page exists so nothing important has to be rushed.
      Mujhe bas tumhe batana hai ki main kaisa feel karta hu tumhare baare mein. I want to tell you how I feel about you, but I want to do it in a way that feels right for me. I want to be honest, but I also want to be gentle—with myself and with you.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m writing this without urgency, and without expectation.
      
    </p>

    <p>
      Mujhe kaafi time se tumse kehna tha ,to be honest 9th Class se hi tumse kehna chahta tha but I was scared of the consequences. I never even tried to make the step, maine tumse baat karne ki bhi koshish nhi kari but I always wanted to talk to you.
    </p>

    <p> I always wanted to tell you how I felt about you but was scared ki tumhara kya reaction hoga. But now I have decided that I will not let my fear stop me from expressing my feelings. I want to tell you that I like you and I have liked you for a long time and will like you. I have never said this to anyone before but I want you to know that you are special to me and I care about you a lot.</p>

    <p>Don’t feel like you have to respond, or even read this if it’s too much. This is just something I needed to say, and I wanted to say it in a way that felt true to me.</p>

    <p>
      Over time, I just felt more and more, mujhe samjh nhi aata tha ki tumse kaise baat karu , tumse baat karne ka try karta tha toh darrr lagta tha ki tumhara kya reaction hoga, iss vajah se tumse baat tak nhi kar paaya but I always felt that there was something special about you.
    </p>

    <p>
       I always felt that there was something about you that made me want to be around you, even if I didn’t know how to express it. I always felt that there was something about you that made me want to be a better person, even if I didn’t know how to show it.
    </p>

    <p>Ab jab school khatam ho gya, sabki life different different directions mein turn le legi so I thought ki tumhe confess kar dena chahiye, I hope ki tum yeh sab padh rahi hogi. </p>

    <p>I just like you , no matter the conditions, no matter the circumstances. I like you for who you are, not for anything you do or don’t do..</p>

    </p>

    <p>Agar tum yeh sab padh rahi ho toh apna opinion bhi share karna connect page pe jaake if you want tabhi karna, varna its okay, main baakiyo ki tarah nhi hu jo tumhe force karu ya kuch, mujhe bss regret mein nhi rehna ki tumhare saath same school mein 4 saal tak raha phir bhi nhi keh paaya.</p>  

     

    <p>
      Maine kabhi kabhi tumse baat karne ka bhi try kiya tha par nervous ho jaata tha kyunki pata tha tumhe yeh sb se koi mtlb nhi hai, tum inn sab cheezo se durr ho, I know ki shayad tumse yaha tak padha bhi nhi hoga, its just mujhe apni feelings share karni thi.
    </p>
    
    
    <p>Yeh 4 saal kaise nikal gye pata bhi nhi chala, na main tumse kabhi bol paaya na kabhi tumse dosti karne ka try kiya, bss tumhe admire hi kiya inn chaar saalo mein</p>


    <p>Agar tumhe mujhse baat karni ho toh tum connect page par jaa sakti ho , If you ever feel like to talk</p>
    
    <p>
      This isn’t a request. It’s a release.
      A way of saying: you mattered deeply to me.
    </p>

   
    <p class="no-pressure">
      No response is needed. Just thank you for being who you are.
