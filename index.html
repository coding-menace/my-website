    <h2>A Letter I’ve Held for a Long Time</h2>

    <p>
      I don’t know exactly when it began. Maybe slowly. The kind of feeling that settles in without asking.
Over time, my thoughts started carrying your presence—quietly, without any urgency.
    </p>

    <p>
      Loving you never felt heavy. It felt like something I could hold gently, without expecting anything back. I admired you from a distance, respected your space, and learned to be patient with my own feelings.
    </p>

    <p>
      There were moments I thought about speaking, and moments I chose silence. I never wanted to rush something that mattered to me. This feeling became a calm part of my life—like a familiar song playing softly in the background.
    </p>

    <p>
      This page isn’t a request. It’s a release. A way of saying:
      <em>you mattered deeply to me, and that truth deserves air.</em>
      If this changes nothing, that’s okay. If it changes everything,
      we can take it slowly.
    </p>

    <p class="no-pressure">
      No response is needed. Just thank you for existing as you are.
